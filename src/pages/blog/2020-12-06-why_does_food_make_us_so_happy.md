We usually have a bad face when we feel empty our stomach, and this seems an ancestral
premise that accompanies us until the end. In the beginnings of history, mankind was only
concerned with three things: procreation, not being hunted by predators, and feed.

Due to the carnivorous character of man, the homo species got a bigger brain mass, which
made him smarter and more aware. You can say, with no reservations that without the ancient
man's eating plan, maybe we would still worry about going back to our caverns before
hunters chase us in the night, instead of worrying about the traffic that It’ll slow us down a
few minutes on the way to work.

Food is vital to human existence. **Arthur Schopenhauer**, the famous pessimistic german
philosopher, claimed that a will impelled us to desire things. That will is the will to live, and
if we do not please her, Schopenhauer predicts that you will suffer a lot.

Needs are inherently linked to our **behavior** and **biology**. This is demonstrated in a
resounding way when measuring brain activities of someone while eating: their endorphins
and opioids shoot endlessly! That's what people call satisfaction and satiety.

But the primary work of food doesn’t stop there, and it creates a world for which it doesn't
have! since satiety is only one of the rewards of having a healthy and rich diet of nutrients
from all food groups. In fact, the amino acids that we eat help us to create the tissues that
form our muscles.

In the same way, food contributes to improve our mental skills and our state of mind; it
determines the growth of our bodies, and also provides health. It’s no joke when we say that
“we are what we eat!”

Why does food make us happy? When we eat we think consciously in all this? The answer
has to go beyond all these advantages: the food is part of us, our identity and our way of
living. Food is the friend who never abandons us and who accompanies us every day of our
lives.

In **Box Lunches,** with our food individually packaged, we seek that unconditional friend is
always with you. The **catering** and **delivery** that we have in **Seattle** is so important for this
reason: we take care of removing the bad face of employees, guests or participants of an
event, bringing the smile of a great friend: our wonderful dishes!
